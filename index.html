        		<h1>Nice to meet you!</h1>
				<p>
					I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Intuit AI, where I’m passionate about identifying opportunities where AI can solve major customer problems and enhance user experiences. My focus is on personalization and generative AI, creating solutions that make a real impact in user-facing products.			 
				</p>
				<p>
					During my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of New Orleans, I developed novel deep learning systems to identify deficiencies in levee systems using images captured by UAVs. This research honed my expertise in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, driving my commitment to innovative problem-solving.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’m also dedicated to empowering women in tech through my involvement with Nepali Women in Computing (NWiC) and as an ambassador for Women in Data Science Kathmandu. I love sharing my passion for AI and inspiring others to pursue their own tech journeys.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a proud member of Nepali Women in Computing (<a href = "https://medium.com/nepali-women-in-computing">NWiC</a>), one of AnitaB Systers Affinity Groups, I’m committed to making a positive difference in the tech community.
