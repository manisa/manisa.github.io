				<p>
					My name is Manisha Panta. I am from Nepal. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of New Orleans (UNO) with a research concentration in Machine Learning, Deep Learning for Computer Vision. My research mainly focuses on understanding defects in the levee system by identifying and localizing them using images, sensor data, and videos collected from Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs). 
				</p>
				
				<p>	
					I have also explored my interest in Conversational AI and Recommendation Systems through my previous internships in the AI team at Intuit. Moreover, understanding customer problems and developing AI solutions by understanding generated data is rewarding as I could see the direct impact of my work.

					An educator who loves sharing her passion for data science and problem-solving techniques. Involvement in several women in tech communities, such as ACM-Women Chapter at UNO, Nepali Women in Computing (NWiC), and an ambassador for Women in Data Science Kathmandu, provide me the platform to attain it.
